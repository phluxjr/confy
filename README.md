## installation

### from AUR (arch linux)
```bash
yay -S confy-tui
```

### from nixpkgs (unstable)
```bash
nix-shell -I nixpkgs=https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/archive/nixos-unstable.tar.gz -p confy-tui
```

[confy is in nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/543546#event-28187717813) under the name `confy-tui`.

### from cargo
```bash
cargo install confy-tui
```

### build from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phluxjr/confy.git
cd confy
cargo build --release
sudo install -Dm755 target/release/confy /usr/local/bin/confy
# optionally install the man page
sudo install -Dm644 confy.1 /usr/share/man/man1/confy.1
```

## dependencies

none required for core functionality.

two commands need optional system tools:
* `:device` (remote profiles) needs [`sshfs`](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) installed
* `:su` (elevated editing) needs `pkexec` (polkit), and for use with `:device`, `user_allow_other` set in `/etc/fuse.conf` on your local machine
* `:git commit` / `:git push` need `git` installed

confy will tell you clearly if any of these are missing rather than crashing.

## usage

just run `confy` in your terminal.

### navigation

* `j/k` or `arrow keys` - move up/down
* `enter` - open file in $EDITOR (or toggle group)
* `space` - toggle group expand/collapse
* `p` - toggle live preview pane
* `/` - search mode
* `:` - command mode
* `q` - quit

### commands

* `:stats` - open the full-screen stats dashboard with themed metric cards, edit-share bars, a ranked configs-most-opened leaderboard, editing streak and most active day, milestones, a theme palette, sortable config activity (`s` toggles sorting), and the confy config directory's creation date
* `:diff` - compare the selected config with each retained backup; press `r` to restore the selected version
* `:hooks` - open `~/.config/confy/hooks.toml` in your configured editor

stats milestones include `you're in`, `oops`, `collection`, `hoarder`, `storage room`, `configs: managed`, `dotfile demon`, `editorial`, `welcome to confy!`, `new clothes!`, `self-sewed`, `thrift shop`, `going live`, `haunting a remote machine`, `with great power..`, `happy birthday to me!`, and `one of us`. press `m` in the stats dashboard to view the full milestone wall.
* `:import [chezmoi|stow|yadm]` - find configs managed by one of these tools, review the list, and choose what to track

you can start the same import review without opening the main interface with `confy import [chezmoi|stow|yadm]`. candidates are preselected unless already tracked; use `space` to toggle, `a` to select all, `n` to clear, and `enter` to save the selected configs.

#### command-line shortcuts

* `confy l` / `confy last` - open the last edited config before entering the tui
* `confy s:<text>` - open the tui with search prefilled
* `confy o:<path> [g:<group>]` - track and open a file
* `confy d:<host>` - switch to a remote device before opening the tui
* `confy stats` / `confy milestones` - open the matching dashboard directly
* `confy hooks` - edit the hooks configuration
* `confy st:share` - print copyable markdown stats
* `confy st:img`, `confy st:banner`, `confy st:post` - write a themed svg stats image; add `:transparent` for a transparent canvas or `to:<path>` to choose the output path
* `confy completions <bash|elvish|fish|powershell|zsh>` - generate shell completions
* `confy h`, `confy help`, or `confy man` - show usage; `confy v`, `ver`, `version`, `e`, or `edition` - show version information

completion scripts come from clap's shell generators; install the generated script using your shell's normal completion directory.

#### hooks

`~/.config/confy/hooks.toml` runs commands asynchronously through `sh -c` after confy events. each command receives `CONFY_EVENT` and `CONFY_FILE` environment variables. supported events are `opened`, `changed`, `rolled_back`, `restored`, `tracked`, and `untracked`. restoring from `:diff` triggers both `rolled_back` and `restored`.

```toml
[hooks]
opened = []
changed = ["notify-send 'confy' \"$CONFY_FILE changed\""]
rolled_back = []
restored = []
tracked = []
untracked = []
```

edit the file with `:hooks` in the tui or `confy hooks` from the shell. hook commands run as your user and in the background.

#### file management
* `:ac` - add config to ungrouped
* `:ac <group>` - add config to specific group
* `:rm` - remove selected file from tracking (does not delete the file)
* `:l` - open last edited file
* `:rb` - rollback selected file to last backup
* `:diff` - browse backup diffs and restore a selected version
* `:su` - open selected file with root via pkexec (needs polkit)

#### remote profiles
* `:device <host>` or `:ssh <host>` - mount and browse a remote host's tracked configs over sshfs (accepts an `~/.ssh/config` alias or a literal `user@host`)
* `:device local` - switch back to your local configs
* `:device` (no args) - show the currently active device, if any

#### git integration
* `:git sync` - copy all tracked configs into your dotfiles repo (organized by group)
* `:git commit` - sync + prompt for a commit message
* `:git push` - sync + commit + push to remote
* `:git dir` - change the dotfiles repo path interactively
* `:git dir <path>` - set the dotfiles repo path directly
* `:git reset` - reset dotfiles repo path to `~/dotfiles-git`
* `:bl` - toggle git blacklist on the selected file or group (blacklisted items are skipped by `:git sync`)
* `:bouncer` - open a menu to bulk-manage the git blacklist (space to toggle, Z to confirm)

#### appearance
* `:theme <name>` - switch color theme (`catppuccin`, `dracula`, `gruvbox`, `nord`, `tokyo-night`, `one-dark`, or any custom theme)
* `:theme` (no args) - list available themes
* `:theme list` - list built-in and custom themes separately
* `:theme new` - guided wizard to create a custom theme (base or blank)
* `:theme delete <name>` - delete a custom theme
* `:streamer` - toggle streamer mode (hides paths and timestamps)

#### group management
* `:ag <group>` - add new group
* `:mg <group>` - move selected file to group
* `:rg <group>` - remove group (moves files to ungrouped)

#### sorting & filtering
* `:sort name` - sort alphabetically
* `:sort date` - sort by last modified
* `:sort size` - sort by file size
* `:reverse` - toggle ascending/descending order
* `/` then type - search files and groups in real-time

#### configuration
* `:cd` - change config directory (opens built-in file picker)
* `:cd <path>` - set config directory directly
* `:cd reset` - reset to ~/.config
* `:q` - quit

### rollback

confy saves up to three gzipped backups per tracked file in `~/.local/share/confy/backups` before editing. backups are keyed by the full path, so files with the same name in different directories do not collide. `:rb` restores the latest backup.

rollback can be disabled in config.toml:
```toml
[settings]
rollback = false
```

### web editor

start the browser editor with `confy --web`. the interactive setup asks for gui or text mode, ip address, port, and an optional password. the gui provides confy's grouped file browser and command interface; text mode opens a terminal-style browser with j/k navigation and vim-style editing (`i` to insert, `esc` to return to normal mode, `:wq` to save). both use the active confy theme and save a backup before writing.

launch flags override their corresponding prompts. use `-ni` to skip setup prompts and use defaults: gui mode, `127.0.0.1`, port `3000`, and no password.

```sh
CONFY_WEB_PASSWORD='choose-a-password' confy --web --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 3000 --gui -ni
```

other launch flags are `--text`, `--mode gui|text`, `--password password`, `--no-password`, `--ip address`, and `--port port`. when exposing the server beyond localhost, use a tls reverse proxy; the built-in server uses http and does not encrypt traffic. only tracked files are listed.

### git integration

`:git sync` copies your tracked configs into `~/dotfiles-git` (or wherever `git_dir` points), organized by group name. files in named groups go into a folder with the group's name. ungrouped files with a shared filename prefix (e.g. `hyprland.conf` and `hyprlock.conf`) get auto-sorted into a folder named after that prefix.

`:git commit` and `:git push` sync first, then prompt for a commit message in the terminal. `:git push` requires at least one prior commit to exist. make your initial commit manually.

use `:bl` on any file or group to exclude it from syncing (useful for `.env` files or anything sensitive). `:bouncer` gives you a full menu to manage the blacklist in bulk.

git settings in config.toml:
```toml
git_dir = "~/dotfiles-git"
git_blacklist = ["/home/user/.config/some/secret.env"]
git_blacklist_groups = ["personal"]
git_auto_push = false
git_auto_commit = false
```

### themes

confy ships with six built-in themes: `catppuccin` (default), `dracula`, `gruvbox`, `nord`, `tokyo-night`, and `one-dark`. switch with:
```
:theme dracula
```
applies instantly and persists to config.toml, no restart needed. run `:theme` with no arguments to list all available themes.

#### custom themes

you can create your own themes. run:
```
:theme new
```
this opens a guided wizard that:

1. asks you to name your theme
2. lets you start from a **base theme** or a **blank template**
3. walks you through editing each color (`bg`, `fg`, `highlight`, `group`, `border`)

press `s` on the color screen to save and apply. custom themes are written as TOML files in `~/.config/confy/themes/<name>.toml`, so you can also edit them by hand:

```toml
bg = "default"
fg = "default"
highlight = "#cba6f7"
group = "#89b4fa"
border = "default"
```

colors accept named colors (`black`, `red`, `green`, `yellow`, `blue`, `magenta`, `cyan`, `white`, `default`) or hex values like `#89b4fa`. missing keys fall back to defaults, so a minimal file works fine.

other theme commands:
```
:theme list            # list built-in and custom themes
:theme delete <name>   # remove a custom theme
```

### streamer mode

`:streamer` toggles streamer mode, which hides full file paths and timestamps. only filenames are shown. useful if you're on stream and don't want your username or directory structure visible. persists to config.toml, or set it directly:
```toml
[settings]
streamer_mode = true
streamer_hide_git = true
```

### preview pane

press `p` to toggle a live preview pane alongside your file list. it shows the first lines of the selected file, updating as you move the selection. works correctly on a mounted `:device` too. your preference persists across restarts.

### remote profiles (`:device`)

`:device <host>` mounts a remote machine's entire filesystem over sshfs and switches confy's view to that host's tracked configs, letting you browse and edit them exactly like local files.

```
:device phluxjr           # resolves an alias from ~/.ssh/config
:device phluxjr@exam.ple  # or connect directly
:device local             # switch back to your own configs
```

requires [`sshfs`](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) installed locally. if the remote host is running an older confy that predates `config.toml` (i.e. still on `tracked.json`), confy will refuse to connect and ask you to update confy there first.

while on a device, the header shows `[remote: <host>]` so it's always clear you're not looking at your local files. edits, previews, sorting, and rollback all work through the mount.

### elevated editing (`:su`)

select a file and run `:su` to open it with root via `pkexec`. works on local files and on files viewed through a mounted `:device`.

needs `pkexec` (polkit) installed. for `:su` to work while a device is mounted, your local machine also needs `user_allow_other` uncommented in `/etc/fuse.conf`. confy will tell you if it's missing.

### search mode

press `/` to enter search mode, then start typing:
* filters both files and groups in real-time
* case-insensitive matching
* `enter` to confirm, `esc` to clear and show all files

### groups

groups are purely organizational. your actual config files stay in their original locations. `ungrouped` always appears at the bottom of the list regardless of sort mode.

groups are collapsible, press `space` or `enter` on a group header to toggle.

## configuration file

confy stores everything in `~/.config/confy/config.toml`.

upgrading from an older version that used `config.json`? confy keeps your old file, copies it to `config.json.bak`, and migrates the contents into `config.toml` on first run. upgrading from `tracked.json`? confy migrates that automatically too.

full example config.toml:
```toml
last_opened = "/home/user/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf"
collapsed_groups = []
sort_mode = "name"
sort_order = "asc"
config_dir = "/home/user/.config"
preview_enabled = false
git_dir = "/home/user/dotfiles-git"
git_blacklist = []
git_blacklist_groups = []
git_auto_push = false
git_auto_commit = false

[groups]
hyprland = ["/home/user/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf"]
nvim = ["/home/user/.config/nvim/init.lua"]
ungrouped = []

[settings]
rollback = true
first_startup = false
theme = "catppuccin"
background_enable = false
background_color = "#1e1e2e"
streamer_mode = false
streamer_hide_git = true
ssh_allow = true

[settings.colors]
bg = "default"
fg = "default"
highlight = "#cba6f7"
group = "#89b4fa"
border = "default"
```

### settings reference

| key | description | default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rollback` | save a backup before every edit | `true` |
| `theme` | active color theme | `"catppuccin"` |
| `background_enable` | draw a solid background instead of terminal default | `false` |
| `background_color` | background color (hex) | `"#1e1e2e"` |
| `streamer_mode` | hide paths and timestamps in the file list | `false` |
| `streamer_hide_git` | also hide git-blacklisted files in streamer mode | `true` |
| `editor` | override `$EDITOR` (useful for .desktop launchers) | `null` |
| `ssh_allow` | enable `:device` / sshfs integration | `true` |

## why confy?

tired of doing `cd ~/.config/whatever` a million times a day? same. confy keeps all your important configs in one list so you can jump to them instantly.

organize related configs into groups, search through everything, sort however you want, and open files in your editor with a single keypress. if you break something, roll it back. if you want your dotfiles in git, `:git push` and you're done.

simple, fast, does one thing well.

## examples
```
# start confy
confy

# create some groups and add configs
:ag hyprland
:ac hyprland

# move a file between groups
:mg shell

# search for configs
/hypr

# sort by recently modified, newest first
:sort date
:reverse

# oops, broke your config
:rb

# switch theme
:theme tokyo-night

# toggle preview pane
p

# check on your server's configs
:device phluxjr
:su
:device local

# sync dotfiles to git
:git push

# going live? hide your paths
:streamer
```

## tips

* set `export EDITOR=nvim` in your shell rc, or use the `editor` setting in config.toml
* use groups to organize by application (hyprland/, nvim/, kitty/)
* use `:sort date` to quickly find recently edited configs
* use `:bl` on `.env` files or anything sensitive before running `:git sync`
* collapse groups you don't use often to keep the view clean
* missing files show up in red so you know when a config has moved
